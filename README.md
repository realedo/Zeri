Zeri is now updated to alpha 1.03 feturing better ui(text labels dont show anymore when noting is typed onto them) and bug fixes. only.py file is ditributed as you have to manually copy path for images(icon and background) you can find in 1.02 release.

# How does it work

Now Zeri is only a simple python program that given summoner name and region calls riot api for all kind of informations.
all the data is collected by tkiner input. The api is ten called and the data is written in the terminal(soon going to be deleted) and then displayed in tkinter labels. The terminal is visible(soon going to be deleted).

# What comes next

The app now runs on tkinker. Future udates will be featuring full last game data and beter ui while not supporting visible terminal anymore.
the next step would be building a full functioning application for beta testing.
then i make the py application work with a javascript one to make it work on HTML
