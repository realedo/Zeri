# Zeri
Zeri is a work in progress riot api based on python. Zeri is strictly ideated for the Italian League of Legends Community

# How does it work
Now Zeri is only a simple python program that given summoner name and region calls riot api for all kind of informations

# What comes next
My idea is to make a simple Ui for the script so i can release a closed beta dist of my file to a small comunity.
Then i want Zeri to work closely with a javascript program to display inputs and outouts to a HTML page
